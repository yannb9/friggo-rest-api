# friggo-rest-api

##Overview
Simple Rest API that returns a json with two parameters: products and inventory
The product method returns an array of products and the inventory method returns an array of objects.

I'm building an app around this where i can only add items that are related to the product list and if the item type is not listed
in the product array to return an error message.
